# Notifications by Webhook

Webhooks are used to automatically receive notifications of events that happen. For example, when an order has a schedule change.

Once an event is received on the server, it can be processed and action taken as required.

Currently, there're four kinds of notifications available

1. <mark style="color:green;">order.ticketed</mark>
2. <mark style="color:green;">order.scheduleChange</mark>
3. <mark style="color:green;">order.addonComplete</mark>
4. <mark style="color:green;">order.refundComplete</mark>
