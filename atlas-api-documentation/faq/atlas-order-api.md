# Atlas Order API

#### Q. Does the OrderAPI hold the inventory? If yes, then for how long?

A. We will provide 30 mins to complete the payment for each order after it is generated. You can pay for it during this period without fare change.

#### Q. What is mechanism to release the inventory which is on “Hold”?

A. We will hold the inventory after the order API calls, and we have our own mechanism to release the inventory. There are different mechanisms for different airlines and hence we cannot provide a function to release the inventory if you request to release it.
