# Atlas API Payments

#### Q. What Payment methods (Credit card, agency credit, etc.) does Atlas accept?

A. We are open to discuss the payment method. We usually facilitate use of agency VCC or advance payment of positive cash balance.



#### Q. When can I use the credit card for the payment?

A. We provides two kinds of payment solutions.

The first one is that you can pay the full ticket amount plus technical service fees to Atlas, and Atlas will take the responsibility to settle with the airlines.

The other one is that you can send your credit card information in the \[IssueTicket] request. Atlas will pass-through the credit card to the airlines, and the airlines will settle with you directly. In this situation, Atlas will just deduct technical service fee from your account in Atlas.

Several airlines provide these pass-through options for which we have a tag called "supportCreditTransPayment" in the routing element for each fare.
